# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
### Simulation of a Geometric Brownian Motion with Java
---

**Ester Hlav, May 2017**

This program is an *Option Pricing Model* based on the *Black-Scholes formula*. It includes both an **Option Pricing Calculator** as well as a  **Geometric Brownian Motion Simulator** based on a random generator. 
Additionaly, based on parameters given by the user, the program can calculate **implied volatility** and **Greeks** (*i.e.* the derivatives of an option value regarding the different factors such as stock price, strike price, volatility etc.) as well as output diagrams of **option payoff** and **volatility smile**. 
All calculated and simulated outputs are well-known concepts in the field of quantitative finance and derivative contracts and are using parameters from the Black-Scholes formula.
Finally, a GUI with a brief introduction to options and option pricing was developed for users new to the field of quantiative finance.
