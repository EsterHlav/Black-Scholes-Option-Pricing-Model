# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
### Simulation of a Geometric Brownian Motion (Java)
---

**Ester Hlav, May 2017**

This program contains an **Option Pricing Calculator** based on the Black-Scholes formula and generates **simulation of Geometric Brownian Motion**. Additionally, based on the input parameters from the user, the program can also calculate implied volatility as well as Greeks, and display a diagram of option payoff and volatility smile. All calculated and simulated outputs are a well-known concept in the field of quantitative finance and derivative contracts, and are using into great extent the parameters from the Black-Scholes formula. Moreover, user has the possibility to obtain an introduction to derivatives and test his knowledge in a GUI implemented quiz.

For more detailed information on the program's structure and the underlying mathematics used, please report to **[Explanations.pdf](https://github.com/EsterHlav/Black-Scholes-Option-Pricing-Model/blob/master/Explanations.pdf)**
